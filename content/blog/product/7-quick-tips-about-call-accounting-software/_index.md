With phones fast becoming our latest oxygen, it seems hard, rather impossible, to try to spend our lives without them. It thus only makes sense to try and organize our lives as we use the phone, making things easier to manage and practical.

Call accounting software is one similar attempt at organizing our use of our phones through the help of these software’s, often also available in applications, which monitor our calls made. It basically captures and records our phone usage and estimates the costs incurred. This software can differentiate between outbound and inbound calls and thus estimate the call costs accordingly.

PBXDom has a huge list of call costing options available, which is why it is one of the most trusted and most sought names in the Call Accounting and Cost Allocation options. So what is it that PBXDom offers us in this regard? Read on below to find out.

**1\. What are the Call Costing Options offered?** 
PBXDom mangoes call costs through its call accounting software in multiple ways. Firstly, it has the option to reach an agreement with companies for their preferred charges for long-distance calls. To help satisfy these companies, PBXDom offers a list of all the carriers that offer long-distance calls and their rates to help customers decide. However, that is not the only thing that can be sued to identify the perfect carrier. This is why PBXDom also offers information regarding these carriers’ fixed cost per minute, trunk group costing, message unit costing, banded costing, fixed costs per call, and on­-network / off-network costing, along with much more!

**2\. Tailor your bills, according to your Department** 
If you prefer to receive the call costs for each department or office separately, PBXDom can help you. It helps provide separate bills for each department, buildings, or location. This actually helps one understand which department is costing greater in terms of phone calls and address these issues. To help you receive more details, PBXDom also breaks down the charges according to the employees’ names, extension information such as their department and position. This option is also greatly useful in keeping a check on your employees and doing a survey on employees’ performance. PBXDom also sends your bills and call logs through their call accounting software automatically by email or by posting on a specified website as per the date the company has set.

**3\. Break down Departments’ Equipment Charges** 
Since call costs are not enough to justify the expenditures, PBXDom also keeps track of the equipment bought per each department. It also takes into account the equipment charges and attributes them to each department and employee, respectively.

**4\. Wireless / Cellular Charges** 
If phones are our oxygen, wireless and Cellular connections are our food! With their need rising exponentially, it has become a must to have them in the offices and buildings and anywhere you work. This is why PBXDom also takes into account the amount of expenditure that these wireless and cellular connections. Since these make up a significant portion of the corporate telecom bill, PBXDom calls a courting software also includes these. PBXDom again divides and tabulates the costs incurred according to the departments and employees. These reports provide an insight into who ends up exceeding the allotted minutes, who use the office network to make calls after business hours are over, and who uses this connection to make their personal calls all the time.

**5\. Shared Tenant Billing** 
PBXDom also can separate companies’ bills from other companies that share the same phone system. This separation is significant as, without it, one often lives under the assumption that they might be paying equal or more than their share when it could be the other way round! PBXDom, therefore, bills each company or tenant separately for their calls, using their prefecture long-distance call rates, as mentioned earlier. It also offers the option of adding on chargers like conference room usage, personnel services, etc. As per each tenant.

**6\. Account Code / Authorization Codes / Client Billing** 
If we are differentiating the calls based on employees’ department and names, it is very much possible that employees could use another’s connection in their absence. This is why PBXDom took a step forward and set up Account Codes, Authorization Codes, and Client Matter Codes. These are specific to each employee and are used to trace all calls made back to the employee from anywhere within the facility. It, therefore, does not matter whose extension the connection was used because each call can be traced back to just the person who made it!

**7\. Dig up more hidden charges** 
PBXDom understands that despite all these charges and information provided, some loopholes have left that the cost incurred by hidden charges can explain. PBXDom also takes this into account, and these include salaries, trunk charges, maintenance agreements, lease payments, equipment charges, and more. These are similarly attributed to each employee and department as was done with all the other charges.

With such efficient mechanisms to monitor your calls, PBXDom’s call accounting software has become unparalleled software in this regard to handle accounts and charges. It leaves customers satisfied and updated with all the information regarding their phone charges and leaves them thoroughly happy about being able to manage and make some tweaks as per requirement. So go ahead, get a call accounting software and save loads from your company’s annual expenditure on phone calls and network connections!
